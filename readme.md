How to use:
Highlight the code in exploit.js and put it in your bookmarks bar, then repeat what I do in the video

How it works:
Prevents goguardian and most other extensions from closing a page and redirecting to the block page.


Footnote: This exploit is unpatchable by google, as it doesn't interfere with them. The only way to block this exploit would be to disable bookmarklets/task manager (working on a workaround)
